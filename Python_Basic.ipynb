        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It is popular because it is easy to learn, has a huge library ecosystem, strong community support, and is widely used in fields like Data Science, Machine Learning, Web Development, and Automation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   - An interpreter in Python is the program that executes Python code line by line. It converts the source code into bytecode and runs it on the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). Python uses an interpreter, making it easy to write, test, and debug code quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers. Examples include if, else, for, while, def, class, try, and return. Python currently has 35 keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved words that define the language’s syntax and structure. Using them as variable names causes a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - Mutability in Python refers to whether an object's value can change after creation. Mutable objects like lists and dictionaries can be modified in place, while immutable objects like strings, integers, and tuples cannot be changed and create new objects when modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable because they are implemented as dynamic arrays that allow in-place modifications like adding, removing, or updating elements. Tuples are immutable because they use a fixed memory layout, making them faster, hashable, and safe to use as dictionary keys. Their immutability allows Python to optimize performance and memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - \"==\" checks if two objects have the same value, while \"is\" checks if they refer to the same memory location. \"==\" compares data equality, and \"is\" compares object identity.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   - Logical operators in Python are \"and\", \"or\", and \"not\". They are used to combine conditions in decision-making. \"and\" returns True only if both conditions are true, \"or\" returns True if any condition is true, and \"not\" reverses the truth value.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into another. It can be done explicitly using functions like int(), float(), and str(), or implicitly when Python automatically converts types during operations to avoid data loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    - Implicit type casting is done automatically by Python when safe, such as converting an int to a float during operations. Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer using functions like int(), float(), or str(). Implicit casting avoids data loss, while explicit casting may cause data loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow decision-making by executing specific blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. They help control program flow and implement real-world logic like validation, error checking, and branching.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    - The elif statement allows checking multiple conditions one after another. Python executes the block of the first elif condition that evaluates to True, and skips the rest. It is used when you need multiple decision branches.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "    - A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence and is best when the number of iterations is known. A while loop runs as long as a condition is true and is used when the number of iterations is not fixed. For loops are predictable and safer, while while loops can create infinite loops if the condition is not properly updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "    - A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is unknown and the loop should continue until a certain condition is met. For example,attempt login until correct password.\n",
